## Technologies
For this project, our technology stack encompasses several key components:

We utilize IPFS-NFTStorage to securely store all user profiles, ratings, portfolios, job information, and reviews as NFTs. This ensures data integrity and reliability.

Our smart contract development relies on Solidity and Hardhat, providing a robust and well-tested foundation for our blockchain operations.

To handle the minting and completion of jobs, we employ the OpenZeppelin ERC721 standard, streamlining our contract functionality. We also utilize the ERC721 template for accelerated smart contract development.

For local blockchain development and testing, we turn to Hardhat, which facilitates efficient and reliable development workflows.

On the frontend, we harness the power of Tailwind, Next.js, and React.js to create an engaging and user-friendly interface. Ethers.js serves as the bridge to connect with the blockchain.

In addition, we incorporate WorldCoin to enhance the functionality of our platform.

To ensure scalability and accessibility across various networks, we leverage The Mantle, Scroll and Polygon Network for our deployment strategies.
